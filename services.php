          <h3>Role Of Student In Education Level Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            In our country, however civic duties have been included in the education theory.
            However not all students have their complete knowledge, if today's students want to improve the level of
            education by keeping the spirit of knowledge acquisition and not using their power in strike sabotage and
            political activities, if we invest in rewoving the short coming of the education field, then surely the
            level of our education can improve.
